This is just a scaffold for a Python FastAPI service.

# Setup
First, install `uv` if needed: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installing-uv

Then, run `uv sync` to install dependencies.

(If you prefer to use regular `pip` / or another tool, there's also a `requirements.txt` you can use with those. Use your venv or system Python instead of `uv run` below.)

# Development
Run `uv run fastapi main.py` to start the development server.

# Tests
Run `uv run pytest` to run tests.
